# Launching

This project uses SCSS and you'll need to compile it.

Use Visual Studio Code with the `Live Sass Compiler` extension. Press `Watch Sass` in the lower right corner to generate the CSS files.

# Configuration

The bracket is configured as a JS object in `/js/index.js`. See full explanation in that file.
